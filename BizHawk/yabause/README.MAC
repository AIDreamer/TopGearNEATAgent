1 Introduction________________________________________________

This file documents the mac version only, for general
information check the README file.


2 Compiling instructions______________________________________

Yabause is written in C and Objective C using the Cocoa,
IOKit, OpenGL, and CoreAudio frameworks. All of these
frameworks should be installed by default on your Mac OS X
system. You must have the Mac OS X 10.6 SDK installed by the
Xcode installer in order to build Yabause. In addition, you
will need at least Xcode 3.2.

Once you have Xcode installed, you should be ready to build
Yabause.

Uncompress the Yabause source archive, and open the
Yabause.xcodeproj in the src/cocoa directory. From there it
should be as easy as hitting the Build or Build and Run
button in Xcode. This should generate a Yabause.app file
that can be run just like any other application bundle on
Mac OS X.


3 How to use Yabause__________________________________________

Before using Yabause, you need to configure a few things in
the Preferences dialog (Yabause > Preferences).


3.1 Configuration_____________________________________________

First, set the BIOS path.
Yabause can run some games without a BIOS, but many of them
need it. If you want to use the emulated BIOS, select the
checkbox for that.

Next, set up the video and sound cores. For the video core,
you have 4 options:
1. OpenGL Hardware Video Core - Potentially the fastest video
   core choice, at least with a discrete video card. However,
   it is also the least accurate.
2. Software Video Core - The most accurate video core you can
   use, but also the slowest.
3. Grand Central Dispatch Software Core - A multithreaded
   version of the Software Video Core. On a multi-core system
   this should be significantly faster than the Software core
   with a similar accuracy level.
4. Disable Video - Does exactly what it sounds like.

For the sound core, you only have two options:
1. Core Audio Sound Core - The default sound core. Select
   this one if you want sound.
2. Disable Sound - Does exactly what it sounds like.

Next, set up keys for input. Go to the Input tab, and
configure each button (at least on Controller 1). For the
moment, this is limited to keyboard input only.

There are other options you can configure as well in here,
including BRAM (for saving), a MPEG ROM (for games that use
the VideoCD/MPEG card), and a cartridge for the cartridge
port on the Saturn.

Once eveything is set, you can start emulation with the
"File > Run BIOS", "File > Run CDROM" or "File > Run Image"
menu options. Don't use the Run BIOS entry if you're using
BIOS emulation.


4 Known Issues________________________________________________

When running in GDB, you should not use fullscreen mode. If
Yabause crashes while running under GDB in fullscreen mode,
you will probably get stuck with no way to exit. This should
only affect developers and shouldn't ever be an issue for
normal users.
